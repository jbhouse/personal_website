<p>Pictured above is a Greco wrestler performing a suplex, a move in which one wrestler lifts their opponent off their feet, throws them over their own head, and lands their opponent on their back or in any other "danger" position. (neck etc) a throw such as this is awarded 5 points and is the highest scoring move in greco wrestling, often ending the match.</p>
